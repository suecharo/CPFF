DESCRIPTION :
  ARGPARSER: KPHMMER; Hidden Markov Model generator for detecting KEGG pathway-specific genes written by suecharo. <hirotaka.suetake@riken.jp>
  SUBPARSER: KPHMMER has each submethod. Refer to the help of each submethod.
  QUERY: Receive the KEGG organism code and output the Pfam domain file in the form of yaml file. If you do not know KEGG's organism code (e.g. hsa), use search method.
  SEARCH: Receive query keywords (e.g. human) and search KEGG's organism code (e.g. hsa).
  ANALYSIS: Receive the Pfam domain file in the form of yaml file as input and output hmm file created by frequently detected Pfam domains in the set category.
  CONVERT: Receive the Pfam domain file in the form of yaml file and output the gene included therein in the form of FASTA file.
  CONFIG: Check the currently set category. Or change the setting.

QUERY:
  ORGANISM: Specify KEGG's organism code (e.g. hsa). Multiple inputs are accepted.
  OUTPUT: Specify where output file is generated. (default = ./)
  ANALYSIS: If you want to do analysis together, specify this option.
SEARCH:
  QUERY: Perform the keyword search on the input character string.
  ALL: Display all organism codes present on KEGG. Be careful as there are many outputs.
ANALYSIS:
  DOMAIN: Specify Pfam domain file path in the form of yaml file. Multiple inputs are accepted.
  OUTPUT: Specify where output file is generated. (default = ./)
CONVERT:
  DOMAIN: Specify Pfam domain file path in the form of yaml file. Multiple inputs are accepted.
  OUTPUT: Specify where output file is generated. (default = ./)
CONFIG:
  DEFAULT: Restore config to the default values.
  1ST: Set 1st category. Multiple inputs are accepted.
  2ND: Set 2nd category. Multiple inputs are accepted.
  DUPLICATE: Set which categories to place duplicates.
